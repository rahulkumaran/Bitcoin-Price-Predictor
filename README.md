# Bitcoin Price Predictor

This particular project was developed on 11th March, 2018 for a Hackathon, organised by JNTUHCEH, in collaboration with Colaberry, a leadin Data Science educator in the USA and Infogrex Technologies.<br><br>

Here, we were given the datasets, and were told to perform a data science and predict the price of bitcoins. <br>
Using basic data viz techniques, I narrowed down on a couple of features needed to feed as the input the the ML algorithm.<br><br>

Here, I used Linear Regression and predicted the price of bitcoins. The closing price of a day is predicted.<br>
